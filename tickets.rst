Batch commands
==============

One should be able to pass a list of bugids for any command
Two options proposed:

- compatible, passing multiple bugids, space-separated, in the same cmdline argument
- changing bugid position in cmdline, before the command when bugid needed
    - implies detection of number of bugids passed, quite easy since list of commands is known...

Add dropdown to change bugs order in serve view
