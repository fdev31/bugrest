More tests would be nice
========================

There is clearly a defficiency in the coverage

JIRA: add support for comments
==============================

:bugid: 10
:created: 2017-11-16T00:11:04
:priority: 0

Syncing JIRA comments would be nice

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FEATURE: labels
===============

:bugid: 11
:created: 2017-11-16T22:56:10
:priority: 0

One could add ONE label to an issue
It would group the items as with priorities
- one can chose between priorities, labels or both in groupping
- labels are shown aside tags when not used to group

Alternatively, one could name priorities, but sounds more hackish

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Batch commands
==============

:bugid: 12
:created: 2017-11-16T23:00:05
:priority: 0

One should be able to pass a list of bugids for any command
Two options proposed:

- compatible, passing multiple bugids, space-separated, in the same cmdline argument
- changing bugid position in cmdline, before the command when bugid needed
    - implies detection of number of bugids passed, quite easy since list of commands is known...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Support some HTML to RST while pulling JIRA bugs
================================================

:bugid: 13
:created: 2017-11-16T23:01:32
:priority: 0

An option could allow html to be stripped
Another option could be to colorize HTML for better readability

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

===================================================

:bugid: 15
